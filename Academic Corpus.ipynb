      "that's one of the reasons why they started er a kind of a new wave of the genre \n",
      "of the policiers er in French cinema er but what's interesting about them with \n",
      "the exception of Bob le Flambeur which was very much an independent production \n",
      "is that films like Rififi like Grisbi were very much if you like in Hollywood \n",
      "terms there would be A productions in the sense of the directors were well \n",

       "\"nf0069: when talking about the French gangster film very often and \\nparadoxically in French one talks about the policier that's the name of the \\ngenre so when you you see the word policier er I-E police which relates to the \\npolice it doesn't necessarily mean that it's to do with a police film or police \\nprocedure as the you have in the American genres but it's co-, covers all er \\nvirtually all the films er to do with crime er pretty much from the nineteen-\\nfifties onwards so er a gangster film and a police film will both be called \\npolicier in French and sometimes you'll see the in slang this becomes polar er \\ni'm sorry i hope it's not too awkward if i move er polar is P-O-L-A-R er is yep \\nsf0070: sorry \\nnf0069: okay we're just beginning polar is the slang word for policier so le \\npolar refers to the genre of the police crime gangster movie in French er \\nspecifically from the nineteen-fifties late forties fifties onwards and so that \\ni will \\ntalk today about a particular genre or subgenre of French crime films and film \\nnoir which arises in the mid-fifties especially with three key movies which are \\nthe ones that are at the top of your handout er and that is Touchez pas au \\nGrisbi which i'll refer to as Grisbi er Du Rififi Chez les Hommes ri-, Rififi \\nand er Bob le Flambeur the film you're going to see this afternoon er okay and \\ner the theme of the lecture in a sense will be that of hybridity and especially \\nhybridity between French and American culture French and America cinema er and \\nto start starting with literature so that if you look at the bottom of your \\nhandout there's er a kind of s-, skeleton of the er lecture and er i will start \\nwith the literary origins of the genre because er when it comes to those \\ngangster films those policiers of the mid-fifties starting particularly with \\nTouchez pas au Grisbi but also some Eddie Constantine movies er earlier on er \\nthey are films which are very directly related to er \\nliterature to crime literature and in particular the famous Serie Noire er \\nwhich i've already mentioned which was an imprint of the er French publisher \\nGallimard er which started at the er immediately at the end of the war and has \\nremained extremely successful i brought you so just to make you er like to one \\nof these to show you er this is an original Serie Noire book er it's very \\nprecious to me it actually happens to be the one on which er Goddard's film \\nPierrot le Fou is very loosely based er in English or American it's called \\nObsession and this one in French it's called Le DÃƒÂ©mon d'Onze Heures if you \\nread it it's very very distantly related to Pierrot le Fou in case you know \\nthat film er but i just wanted to show you er the cover that is the original \\ncover er of the Serie Noire and as you can see it's the the background is black \\nand it uses red er yellow lettering er and the series was founded by Marcel \\nDuhamel his name is on \\nyour er er handout who was er an ex-member of the surrealist group in the \\nnineteen-twenties and he was very er much linked to the surrealists throughout \\nthe twenties and the thirties and James Naremore in the book More than Night \\nwhich i've already quoted from says that er er Duhamel was particularly er \\ninterested in er the researches into sexuality which the surrealists conducted \\ner during the the twenties and early nineteen-thirties and in the American hard-\\nboiled er thriller what the surrealists saw as i've already mentioned was er \\nthis notion of eroticized crime whi-, su-, subverting as it were er the fabric \\nof bourgeois society so that er one can see then the relationship er directed \\nto the surrealists through the person of Duhamel er who then in forty-six \\nbegins the series of the Serie Noire and the Serie Noire published primar-, \\ninitially primarily American writers in translation and famously it always says \\nunderneath traduit de l'Americain translated from the \\nAmerican not from the English er even though sometimes some of the writers were \\nBritish but er and also famously a number of French writers wrote for the Serie \\nNoire under American pseudonyms er such was the the aura of so they pretended \\ner to translate work into French from the American which in fact they had \\nwritten into French in the first place but the the the basis of the Serie Noire \\nwas to to publish to translate and publish American writers and Duhamel \\nencouraged also people like Chester Himes for example to to write for the \\nseries er Duhamel one finds also linked to the cinema er in two ways one is \\nthat he was he he appears in a number of films by Jean Renoir in the thirties \\nas an actor and also he wri-, he wrote the preface to the book on film noir by \\nBorde and Chaumeton fa-, book that's already been mentioned er several times er \\nand i think i er also wanted to show you the the cover er and also the cover of \\nanother er Gallimard book to make the point that which i think is \\nis very telling the design of that series is that the book combined the kind of \\nsobriety of Gallimard publishing this is this was Gallimard very famous \\nliterary er imprint looks like this is er a copy of er a book by Marcel Proust \\nbut i could have picked up any they all look the same they have the this cream \\nbackground and the red lettering and this this this design hasn't changed er \\nthroughout the century practically and there is that sense of classicism \\nsobriety and what one sees here i think is is the a kind of mixture of that \\nsobriety and classicism with the lurid colours of pulp fiction the black and \\nthe yellow er colours which tend to appear on a number of artefacts to to \\naround crime and it this is er this is some press material for a film called Du \\nRififi Chez les Femmes which was er a kind of rip off as it were and and follow \\nup to Rififi Chez les Hommes and you see that the black and white background \\nand the and the lurid er yellow colour so er and the er the \\nreason why er i'm talking about the er the Serie Noire writers er in relation \\nto the films is is that they are on the one hand those indirect connections \\nthrough Duhamel between surrealism er literary culture and the cinema but also \\nbecause the three films we're talking about were directly based on or written \\nby er writers from the Serie Noire and in particular you have it on your er \\nhandout er Albert Simonin er who wrote Touchez pas au Grisbi er and i have here \\nthe the book Touchez pas au Grisbi alas it's not an original Serie Noire it's a \\nvulgar folio reprint of the late eight-, eighties but and you can see that on \\nthe cover what they've put is a a kind of er a graphic version of er Gabin \\nJeanne Moreau in the film er so that's the s-, sort of obvious er connection to \\nthe movie for the readers of the eighties er but er Simonin then wrote er \\nTouchez pas au Grisbi in slang and er the the the book was adapted to the film \\nthat you've saw you've seen this morning and Auguste Le Breton \\nwrote er Rififi and he wrote the dialogues of Bob le Flambeur which you will \\nsee this afternoon er after the lecture and the the importance of Le Breton of \\nthose writers in the fifties is shown by the fact that er Jean-Pierre Melville \\nthe director of Bob le Flambeur has er said that he used Le Breton as a \\nmarketing ploy that er at the time he made Bob le Flambeur in nineteen-fifty-\\nfive fifty-six er he was not a well known director the film doesn't have a star \\nunlike Grisbi which had Jean Gabin the star of Bob le Flambeur in nineteen-\\nfifty-six was Auguste Le Breton that's the name that sold the movie today of \\ncourse er it's Jean-Pierre Melville's name which which is prominent but at the \\ntime er Melville recognized that he needed er Le Breton in order to er to sell \\nhis film and Le Breton wrote the dialogue er in the slang which was accustomed \\nto er the writers of the Serie Noire in French okay just a word then about er \\nlanguage er and and that is that er tho-, those books \\nwere written in slang er in the argot that's the French word for slang er but \\nyou you'll come across it a number of times er which er was a a kind of \\nromanticized version of crooks' slang er which has a long history er in in \\nFrench language going back to the late Middle Ages er and which was revived in \\nthe nineteenth century by a number of classic writers like Victor Hugo but also \\ner some of the writers of the popular novels which were the antecedents of the \\ncrime novels people like EugÃƒÂ¨ne Sue his name is written on the er on the \\nhandout so that er that sla-, slang if you like had lo-, very er old history \\nand and er distant origins in French language er and went through a number of \\nrevivals and in the post-war period went through a particularly dramatic \\nrevival through the writers of the of the Serie Noire and the importance of the \\nslang er is is on is felt on many levels and it's it \\nadvertises itself immediately from the titles of the film so for the French \\naudience of the mid-fifties words like grisbi er ha-, chnouf as in Razzia sur \\nla Chnouf which means drugs er rififi and so on were words which were not er \\nnecessarily in everyday use but but had that aura of crim-, criminal language \\nso that right from the title of the films the their er the nature of the \\nliterature on which the films were based and the criminal milieu which was \\nevoked in the film was was made evident er and of course er if you if you don't \\nspeak French the er the kind of flavour of it er is lost and we we have to be \\nreconciled to that but it is quite an important aspect of of the films the way \\nin which the lines are spoken and the the words of slang er which are used and \\nit's it's it was er very important to the film in a way which is made very self-\\nconscious in the films so i want to show you now two extracts before we er move \\non to er the the the the gangster \\nfilms themselves er and especially Grisbi and Bob le Flambeur i want to show \\nyou an extract first of all from er a film with Eddie Constantine er and then \\nan extract from Rififi so i know some of you i hope most of you have seen \\nRififi but er nevertheless we'll s-, we'll look at an extract so backtracking a \\nlittle bit er on on on on the handouts still on the literary origins er you see \\nthat i make mention of American hard-, hard-boiled writers which i've already \\nmentioned so people like Dashiell Hammett Raymond Chandler and so on all those \\nwriters who were translated into the Serie Noire but another one another writer \\nwho was translated and who may not be as meaningful to you today as Chandler \\nand Hammett are was Peter Cheyney who wrote er a series of novels with a a \\nprivate detective called Lemmy Caution er and a-, according to er Jill Forbes \\ner the f-, the very first er book published by Serie Noire was a book \\ncalled Poison Ivy by Cheyney er and that's it's er and it's the book which is \\nadapted er into a film called La MÃƒÂ´me Vert-de-Gris which would translate as \\nThe Vert-de-Gris Chick er sort of that that's the sort of flavour of it and \\nwhich was a film wh-, the f-, wh-, the film which really made Eddie Constantine \\ninto a star and i'm going to show you a quick extract er now Eddie Constantine \\ner was an American but who'd come to work in France he was a singer and he er \\nwas a protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ© of e-, of the singer Edith Piaf I-E lover and she kind of \\nhelped his career initially and then er he started getting parts small parts in \\nmovies and with er La MÃƒÂ´me Vert-de-Gris he became a major star through the the \\nthe mid-fifties and er through the fifties really and the i i will come to sa-, \\nto talk talk later on about er the attitude to American culture in those films \\nbut the er interesting aspect of con-, Eddie Constantine and i pronounce him on \\non purpose as Constantine and not \\nConstantine because he was known as Eddie Constantine in effect he became a \\nFrench star and in fact after he made those movies er he tried to revive his \\ncareer in America and and sort of didn't it didn't work so he was really a \\nFrench star but a French star as an American and in those er movies of the mid-\\nfifties what he represented was the American which in the context of the film \\nmeant a man who was tall who was muscular athletic er who leaps and and er er \\nleaps about er the frame who knocks people er out and so on and he's very often \\nplaced in contrast with French counterparts who tend to be older fatter less \\nathletic and so on sort of if you think of Jean Gabin in Grisbi right and now \\nyou're going to see Eddie Constantine in La MÃƒÂ´me Vert-de-Gris you see what i \\nmean er so er this is a bit towards the end of the film where and i i there are \\nno er subtitles i apologize for that but er it'll be quite obvious he's been \\ncaught by the gang of villains he's investigating and \\namong those villains is the famous chick the la mÃƒÂ´me vert-de-gris the woman er \\nand you will see that she does a kind of dramatic er turnaround and sort of \\ncomes onto his side but just watch for the er er just watch for er the \\nmovements his presence in the frame and if you speak a little bit of French \\njust listen to his accent when he when he speaks \\nnf0069: so that's him \\nnf0069: okay er the we'll sto-, stop it here then then then there's a long \\npursuit on the on the roof er er can can you sorry eject this one and put the \\nnext one in thanks as you can i mean as you can see er i think compared to \\nGrisbi this morning really there's a much \\nmore a lot more action er and there's er more than you see in this extract in \\nthe rest of the film er more physical action er and and the the his figure and \\nand his er er body movements are very different from what you see in something \\nlike Grisbi and what you will see in Bob le Flambeur this afternoon er but what \\nis also very obvious is the kind of er self-consciousness and the parody that \\nthat that perma-, p-, pervades the film and that's something which is i think \\ner very er true of the genre in general but especially so of this Peter Cheyney \\nadaptation it's already in the literature it's already in the books themselves \\nbut the way they play them the way Eddie Constantine er says his lines for \\nexample very much emphasizes this parodic element er and this self-\\nconsciousness and that's the link to er the next extract from Rififi about the \\nself-consciousness and also i wanted to show you that particular moment er well \\nit's very nice anyway but also because er it er reveals the \\nself-consciousness about the use of language and and slang it's towards the \\nbeginning of the film and it's the a scene in a cabaret with a a woman who is \\nwho sings er the the theme song Rififi er and in the the the words of the song \\ntalks about the word rififi itself okay so let's have a look \\nnf0069: what's interesting er about this er well many things are interesting \\nabout this er extract but it's the importance that's given to crime as a \\nspectacle er which is then er m-, what we see here is the perfect er mise-en-\\nabyme yes you know the expression mise-en-abyme a kind of repeated mirror image \\nof something so that wha-, what we have here are for example the relationship \\nbetween the gangster and the gangster moll that's all d-, signified by the \\nwords of the song but also signified by the silhouettes of the dancers er that \\nwe see er projected er and at the same time the importance of the language and \\nthe importance of er the c-, the criminal element are themselves made into a \\nspectacle in \\nthe the song of the woman and a-, and also the dancers er mise-en-abyme in case \\nyou er it's comes a term that comes from heraldry which means that you know \\nthere's an image within an image within an image so that that moment really \\ncondenses a lot of what the rest of the film does er in the mode which is of \\ncourse not er if you've s-, for those who've seen the whole film er that the \\nmode is not the same throughout the film the film is much bleaker than this \\nparticular moment would suggest er er s-, particularly compared to Grisbi and \\nBob le Flambeur but nevertheless er i think that there is that that very \\ninteresting highlighting of the the the elements of the film and also the crim-,\\nof crime as a spectacle okay now er a few words er my point two on the handout \\nabout the place of the gangster films in the French film industry of the time \\ner the films we're talking about were all very popular movies er at the box \\noffice er and hence and especially with Grisbi er Bob le Flambeur and Rififi er \\nthey're films which won prizes and which were popular at the box office and and \\nthat's one of the reasons why they started er a kind of a new wave of the genre \\nof the policiers er in French cinema er but what's interesting about them with \\nthe exception of Bob le Flambeur which was very much an independent production \\nis that films like Rififi like Grisbi were very much if you like in Hollywood \\nterms there would be A productions in the sense of the directors were well \\nknown they're films with stars with large budgets with sets and so on for \\ninstance the sets of Rififi were designed by Alexander Trauner who Alexander \\nTrauner who was er well known set designer er in fact from the er period of the \\nthe poetic realist films ver-, one of the best known set designers in French \\ncinema er and so these are very much A productions g-, big \\nproductions but of course with quote unquote B subjects er and that itself gave \\nrise to a lot of controversy at the time the fact that so much talent and money \\nin in the view of some was was as it were quote unquote wasted on er \\nunimportant trivial and immoral subjects so that er even in a French context \\nwhere censorship was much less er intent on questions of morals of sexual \\nsexual depiction and morality generally er there were controversies about these \\nfilms er the fact that the criminals of course are presented sym-, er with \\nsympathy er that that the spectator is is expected to identify wi-, with them \\nyou identify with Max and his friends and you identify with Bob and his friends \\nin Bob le Flambeur er as you will see er have created controversy and er i know \\nthe the reason why the print of er Grisbi you saw this morning was incomplete \\ner is that er was due to the British censor so the censorship was was worse on \\nthe British side of er as usual er in in relations to morality and \\nand and sexuality and the scene i will show you er in a little while from gris-,\\ner from Grisbi is the scene y-, that that's missing but there were there are \\nlittle bits which are missing and which are no doubt due to to censorship er \\nand w-, one point i would i would plant here in your mind is that and and \\nbecause i'll come back to it at the end of the lecture is er the fact that a \\nstar like Jean Gabin er er saw the renewal of his career in Grisbi er and \\nshortly after this film in the late fifties and early sixties two of the \\nbiggest new stars of French cinema namely Jean-Paul Belmondo and Alain Delon \\nbegan their careers also playing criminals or er or policemen sometimes but or \\ng-, b-, y-, very often gangsters so that there is as it were in the mid-fifties \\nto the early sixties a rise in French cinema of the male star as gangster as a \\ncriminal or a delinquent and and that's that's a very er interesting point and \\nit contrasts quite sharply with what happened er before the \\nwar and and here you can make a direct comparison with Gabin because although \\nin PÃƒÂ©pÃƒÂ© le Moko he played a gangster er in in his other films he tended to \\nplay er a worker maybe a worker driven to crime but to er a h-, a an honest \\nworking class hero and as we discussed even in PÃƒÂ©pÃƒÂ© he was portraying a kind \\nof er honest working class character even though he's a gangster and with er \\nwhen we move to the mid-fifties and early sixties we we see a change a very \\nimportant change er in the way er major male stars begin to er be associated \\nprimarily with figures of gangsters er and the point i would make about the \\nplace of the films in the French film industry er was that they combined \\npopular box office well they combined box office popularity with critical er \\nacclaim in many cases and i think that we can then see them as a very important \\ntransitional er y-, cycle if you like between the tradition of quality and the \\nnew wave that's about to come and it's interesting that er \\nmost of these films certainly Grisbi and and certainly Rififi very much slot \\nwithin the tradition of quality in terms as i say of stars budgets sets et \\ncetera er yet the subjects are not typical quality subjects and er at the same \\ntime they are films which are approved of by the n-, the future new wave \\ndirectors as critics and indeed when the new wave directors begin to make \\nmovies most of them er start by making er thrillers or films with delinquent \\ncharacters and gangsters so think of Godard and A Bout de Souffle think of \\nTruffaut and Shoot the Pianist er er es-, tho-, think of Chabrol er virtually \\nall most of the new wave directors begin by making er thrillers so i think \\nthose films we're looking at this week are very important as a transitional \\npoint between tradition of quality and new wave er another er person i haven't \\nmentioned here is Louis Malle who made Lift to the Scaffold Ascenseur Pour \\nl'Echafaud in fifty-seven whi-, which is a thriller er okay so that that's i \\nthink the the the main point here about how these films are placed within the \\nfilm industry and although some of the critics raise objections as i said about \\nthe morality of the films in particular Georges er interestingly er a critic on \\nthe left Georges Sadoul er who's a Communist critic er raised objections to \\nGrisbi very much along the lines of what a pity that Jacques Becker with all \\nhis talent is making a thriller er now the next point i want to come to is er \\nin a way the the the one of the most important points of about studying those \\nfilms for us er at er in this course is the relationship between er French \\nnational identity and American cultural artefacts and cultura-, and American \\ncinema and how that relationship is played out in the thrillers so er as you \\ncan see on your on your handout the first point i would make here is to \\ncontrast in these films and this is very much something i want us to discuss \\ntomorrow in the seminar er er to look at the contrast \\nor a-, at least the relationship between the iconography which one may say is a \\nvery much er a Hollywood iconography of the the gangsters er now Max and his \\nfriends in Grisbi don't wear trench coats but as you will see in Bob we do see \\ntrench coat the hats the guns er the sharp suits and so on er we have er the \\niconography that Colin McArthur talks about in ho-, er Underworld U-S-A is very \\nmuch there er the cigarettes the drinks the well dressed people jukeboxes er \\njazz musicians er a lot of er artefacts and objects er that we associate or \\ncertainly at the time were associated with American culture litter these films \\nso the way the the characters dress the locations they inhabit er think about \\nthe ubiquitous cabaret er wh-, which you've just seen in in Rififi you've seen \\nthat in in in Grisbi you will see it in Bob le Flambeur er music the role of \\nmusic and and et cetera er very much connotes an American iconography and an \\niconography which people then could relate directly to \\nAmerican gangster films they could see and they'd been seeing since the \\nthirties okay however at the same time er it's certainly in Grisbi and in er \\nBob le Flambeur interestingly differently in Rififi and i hope tomorrow \\nthere'll be enough people who've seen Rififi so we can discuss that in in \\ndetail er at the same time as we have this American iconography er which is \\nvery pervasive both visually and aurally we also have er a particular French \\ntype of mise en scÃƒÂ¨ne which we may recognize you may recognize already from \\nfilms you've seen er in the last two weeks er a more mundane er er type of er \\ndelivery if you like of the story and more of an emphasis on the quotidian on \\ner the temps mort the sort of dead time er a l-, a lot of the time when it \\ndoesn't seem that very much is happening er i used a quote which is from Roland \\nBarthes' er text on on your han-, on the back of the handout which where he \\ndescribes Grisbi in one of his rare look at looks at er a f-, a film at a \\nFrench film as the world of understatement the sense that in the mise en scÃƒÂ¨ne \\nin the way the characters er move in the way they they behave er between each \\nother and so on er there's a sense of understatement of minimalism er we are \\nnot we're not even in the world of the Eddie Constantine movie with a lot of \\nmovement and jumping about and so on and knocking people on the on the on the \\nhead and so on er we're certainly not in in the world of the American gangster \\nfilm we're in a sort of very different world a very hybrid world er i would \\nargue between er the American gangster film and particular traditions of French \\ner quote unquote realist depictions er and i would also use er here i think as \\nas very er telling a quote by er FranÃƒÂ§ois Truffaut who who wrote in his review \\nof Grisbi what happens to the character is less important important than how it \\nhappens so what happens to the characters in Grisbi is less important than how \\nit happens and \\ntherefore one one has this kind of understated mise en scÃƒÂ¨ne throughout the \\nfilm which may seem actually surprising at as er at first indeed it's the first \\nFrench gangster film one sees er it seems that not very much is happening li-, \\nas in PÃƒÂ©pÃƒÂ© le Moko the heist the main criminal activity has already taken \\nplace it's off screen it's already happened we're in a kind of er the world in \\nwhich they they're discussing and they're looking at the reactions the are you \\nall right  the impact of of the crime but not the crime itself okay and \\nhere comes the m-, the little bit from Grisbi which you did not see this \\nmorning thanks to the British censor of the fifties  and that is when \\ner Max takes his friend Riton to er his new flat you remember and they have \\nthis little scene which has become very famous actually er er of \\nMax and Riton eating the pÃƒÂ¢tÃƒÂ© and drinking wine while Max is explaining to \\nhis friend about er er where he's gone wrong basically and if you remember at \\nthe end of that scene he says right okay well we're tired let's go to bed now \\nand there's a cut to the scene in the bank where Max is taking the gold er \\nbullion to to give it to his uncle the fence yes remember you're with me okay \\nso this is what comes in between \\nnf0069: oh okay we can st-, we can stop it there they just er we just see Max \\ngo er get up and go to the bank yeah so can you think of why this would have \\nbeen deleted from the print  no any idea \\nsm0072: well 'cause i've never been candidate so er because because staying \\ntogether and all that kind of wouldn't say homosexual but homoerotic sort of \\nbonding between \\nnf0069: mm \\nsm0072: kind of \\nnf0069: yeah well i think that that's well that's \\napparently that was the reason that it was felt to be slightly shocking those \\ntwo men putting on their pyjamas and and  er going to er bed although \\nthey go s-, separate beds er and but that the reason why i'm i'm i think it's \\nwell first of all it's important you see it so you've seen the complete movie \\nalmost although there are l-, odd little bits missing as well er is is really \\ner the fact that it the film can do without it in terms of narrative it is not \\nparticularly important in relation to er the unfolding of of the story of \\nGrisbi and in fact you can you can understand the film p-, perfectly well \\nwithout it er yet one one could argue i would argue that it's also it's a key \\nscene er in er in the film in emphasizing this mise en scÃƒÂ¨ne of er of the \\neveryday of the quotidian these are two er and and of course er the-, these are \\ntwo gangsters er but what \\nwe see them is doing their teeth and putting on their pyjamas and and er in a \\nway which emphasizes er their lack of glamour although they wear very nice \\npyjamas but but nevertheless they they're kind of er just like middle-aged men \\ngoing to bed and in fact are musing over the a-, the issue of ageing er and \\nTruffaut said in his review of the film er that apart from saying what happens \\nis less important than how it happens and this scene demonstrates that it's not \\nwhat happens it's the how it's it's the relationship between these men which is \\nthe depicted purely in terms of everyday quotidian actions like going to do \\nyour teeth er but Truffaut er also said that this is a film about ageing it's \\nabout about turning fifty and so on and so forth and as you you've noticed what \\nwhen you watched the film this morning it's got a lot of you know er remarks \\nabout er wanting to retire getting old being tired and so on and when Riton \\nlooks at his the bags under his eyes you \\nrecall that it refers to an earlier conversation where Max says you know look \\nat yourself you know you should you should retire you know you've had enough er \\nso that but but it it's it's very much that that sort of that sense of muted \\neveryday action which is at the centre of the film and yet this is a gangster \\nmovie this is a film about gangsters and about criminals er so it seems seems \\nto me to to emph-, to really focus on that hybrid between a French style of \\nmise en scÃƒÂ¨ne and an American type of narrative and also iconography okay er \\ntwo other points about er the the Franco-American er relationship in the film \\none is to do with the use of foreigners and foreignness in the films er that \\nyou will have noticed in Grisbi but this is true in Rififi and you will see \\nthat in Bob that er all the poli-, the French policiers of that period very \\nmuch emphasize foreign characters er a-, among the French characters now er \\nthere's of course the Eddie \\nConstantine film where he's clearly an American but in in the the the more \\ntypical g-, French gangster films of the mid and late fifties what we have is a \\nlot of Italians and a lot of Corsicans now that refers to er there's there's \\nthe ref-, referential reality of er the Corsican Mafia which was an important \\npart of the French underworld er and also with the Italians a kind of nod \\ntowards the American gangster film and references to the Italian er and \\nSicilian Mafia er but also one might want to see thi-, this emphasis on foreign \\ncharacters er and and and look at how er they er behave in relation to the \\nFrench ones er as another er displaced image of the relationship between France \\nand America in the films er that the er the contrast between the behaviour of \\nthe French characters and the behaviour of the non-French characters is always \\nto the advantage of the French ones er that the non-French characters tend to \\nbe the one who betray who are weak er et cetera so that what what what \\nwhat one has there i think encapsulated is the way in which the films play very \\noften on on a f-, on on one level on contrasting unfavourably the French \\ncharacters they tend to be less good-looking er less slim less athletic and so \\non so on the surface there there's a kind of parody of of er particular att-, \\ner French attitude yet at the same time the narrative resolution usually gives \\nthem the upper hand so there's a kind of interesting er play there on er \\nnational identity er and as i say one can read it as as a displacement of er \\nFranco-American relationship er and er w-, as one goes towards the late fifties \\nand the early sixties and we'll we'll see that er when we look at er Alphaville \\nand talk about the new wave and the new wave attitude to the thriller er there \\nthere's there's a more overt er move towards imitating American characters er \\neverybody knows about Jean-Paul Belmondo in A Bout de Souffle imitating Bogart \\nthere's a more kind of self-conscious er play on on \\nFrenchness and non-Frenchness but in those mid-fifties gangster film it's the \\nItalians and the Corsicans and also and the kind of Latin characters or er \\ncharacters with perhaps not to you but to French people foreign sounding names \\nlike an-, Angelo for example and so on er at the same time note that all the \\nmain characters in the film the French characters have American sounding names \\nso it's no accident that the heroes are called Max Bob Tony right in Rififi \\nTony le StÃƒÂ©phanois er in in Grisbi we have Max le Menteur and in er Bob we \\nhave Bob le Flambeur le flambeur means the gambler in in slang so that \\nsm0073: \\nnf0069: as if you y-, sorry \\nsm0073: i thought it was somebody with the name FlambÃƒÂ©  \\nnf0069: well well flambÃƒÂ© in slang means means er yes flambÃƒÂ© means to burn but \\nit's it means in slang it means to play to gamble er and er the you remember \\nwhat i said about PÃƒÂ©pÃƒÂ© \\nle Moko yes that pep-, in PÃƒÂ©pÃƒÂ© you have the the very French name PÃƒÂ©pÃƒÂ© very \\nFrench sounding and le Moko evoked dark darkness er coffee strong coffee et \\ncetera or the the exoticism of the character now think about that name and \\nthink of Max le Menteur Bob le Flambeur Tony er er but especially Max and Bob \\nwhat we have there is a reversal we have the character s-, now have an American \\nsounding name and the name that's attached to it is as it were redresses the \\nbalance to just show that they are French after all so Max le Menteur and Bob \\nle Flambeur yeah so there's an interesting play on on the hero's name er and \\njust a quick word er er on the use of music er in the films er and we'll come \\nback to that er tomorrow in our discussion but the policiers er of the mid-\\nfifties the gangster films of the mid-fifties er herald the arrival of jazz \\nmusic in mainstream French cinema now of course in French cinema in general in \\nFrench culture jazz had arrived in in the nineteen-twenties \\nin the wake of the First World War and was very popular but especially popular \\nwith an intellectual elite er and and that that that's quite clear er there's \\nan enormous enthusiasm for jazz in France er but i-, restricted to a certain \\nartistic intellectual milieu er what the policiers and er in the same way if \\nyou like as the er Serie Noire literature er broadens the audience for American \\nliterature to a very wide French public reading readership in the same way the \\nfilms broaden the audience of jazz music to a very wide French er er set of \\nviewers and er what what is very interesting to trace through the films is the \\ner the way in which well the the the part the music plays and that's what i \\nwant to discuss with you tomorrow as well is look at how that jazz music plays \\nbut note that what the films do and that's why they were successful in in in a \\nway broadcasting the jazz to to a wide audience was to propose there again a \\nkind of hybrid which if you like you could call French jazz that what \\nwhat you have is music that is clearly influenced by jazz music by American \\njazz music but is very often composed by French composers er and er the and the \\nwhat we can measure the success they had by the fact that the the theme tune in \\nboth Grisbi and Rififi became er big hits in in the mid-fifties and er this is \\nthe sheet music for Grisbi er er and apparently the film started a mini craze \\nfor harmonica er music er at at the time er thanks to the success of the er of \\nthe theme tune Grisbi which you remember is Max's tune the f-, one of the first \\nthings he says is i'm going to put my tune on er yeah remember er and think \\nabout when you see Bob er er in a in a little while think about the the role \\nthat that music plays er in setting that hybrid mood between Frenchness and \\nAmericanness er aurally in a s-, and and how that interacts with the way the \\nmise en scÃƒÂ¨ne and the narrative work er visually so er and the the l-, \\ni want to finish er with er the last point on the on your er handout which is \\ner to to offer two er not contrasting but interlocking symptomatic readings of \\nthese films er many people have thought about the success of those American \\ngangster films er er sorry French gangster films of the mid-fifties er and er \\nsought to understand their popularity and why at that particular moment in time \\ner given that there had been crime films before there had been gangster films \\nbefore you know about PÃƒÂ©pÃƒÂ© le Moko you've seen Quai des OrfÃƒÂ¨vres and so on \\nwhy it was at that moment in the mid-fifties that er this particular cycle of \\nGrisbi Rififi Bob and and a few others you've got on the sheet why these at \\nthat particular moment these worked so well and were so successful and and \\nstarted er what what what became in fact er the second major genre of French \\ncinema after comedy er so two possible er readings i will highlight now and er \\nfor you to think about while you watch Bob one is to do with er the \\nargument you've heard last week in relation to Quai des OrfÃƒÂ¨vres er to some \\nextent is that one could read these films as a displacement er of issues to do \\nwith the war and the German occupation of France er this is the a reading \\nproposed by people like Robin Buss er Jean-Pierre Melville himself when he \\ntalks about Bob le Flambeur very much proposes this particular reading of er \\nBob le Flambeur and and his other gangster film as films which are in in effect \\ntalking about the German occupation about the resistance about the war in \\nFrance and w-, one could read them as er a nostalgic revisiting of the war and \\nalso a nostalgic hankering after the prewar period er this is something which i-\\n, incidentally is very explicit in a a British film which i i've put on your \\nrelated viewing list called League of Gentlemen er it's a very different film \\ner but er there the r-, the er nostalgia for the war is incredibly explicit \\nhere i would just say two things er that \\nw-, might help us understand er or at least er see whether one can back up this \\nparticular reading of a film one would be the emphasis on old men on men on the \\nedge of retirement men who've who've had enough who've seen all the battles \\nwho've been through it all and what one could read that as men who've been \\nthrough the war er and so on but also who are there's constant emphasis in in \\nin those films about how er the the underground world is not what it used to be \\nthat it was better before that there was a real code of honour among among the \\nthe gangsters and you know that Grisbi in English is called Honour Among \\nThieves er and er the other thing is that there are moments in those films \\nwhere the iconography e-, evokes er the resistance evokes er i mean there are \\nscenes in cellars er evokes literally underground activities er with the er the \\nresi-, to do with the resistance er there are characters tortured or whom we \\nsee in a position er tied up as if they were about to be tortured \\nor had been tortured and and the-, these evoke very very sort of strong images \\nof the resistance er and resistance l-, er linked activities okay so that's one \\ntype of reading and and there's a lot of course these films are totally to do \\nwith honour loyalty and betrayal and of course loyalty and betrayal are are are \\nkind of values which one c-, one can associate with what happened in the \\nunderground resistance against the the German ge-, in the during the German \\noccupation er okay so that that's one way so it would be a symptomatic \\ndisplaced reading the second one is which is proposed by people like Jill \\nForbes er and and er and a couple of others is to read these films as a mirror \\nquote unquote of contemporary French society a society which was er moving \\ntowards modernity which was being quote unquote Americanized er in in terms of \\ner consumer goods in terms of of culture er and a culture of consumption that \\ner France in the nineteen-fifties is er moving out of of of the post-war \\ner recession and and is is a country being rebuilt we're on almost we're three \\nyears away from General de Gaulle's Fifth Republic and and the real \\nmodernization of France it's the beginning of what er historians called call er \\nles trentes glorieuses which er means er lit-, means literally the three the \\nthirty glorious years meaning the forties er er well from the mid-forties to \\nthe mid er to the late sixties and and seventies the thirty years of economic \\nboom and the rise of the consumer society er France in the fifties then is is \\nbeginning to be in the grips of consumer society er of er increased wealth of \\neconomic boom and one could read then the gangsters as being about er a \\ncommunity which used to be the working class community of the thirties poetic \\nrealist films er of community of workers of producers who've become a community \\nof consumers and consumers who are motivated by individual er gain and er and \\ngreed and \\nso if you like one can then read the gangsters as symptomatic of French society \\nat large er and it's er er desire for consumption er think about how the films \\nare littered with images of conspicuous consumption of wealth of high living \\nliving of er er people drinking champagne or whisky in cabarets and er driving \\nhuge cars sometimes American cars and kind of desiring the objects which are er \\nin for the French linked then to modernity and in the f-, in the context of \\nFrance in the fifties that means to America so that the and the g-, the we see \\nthe gangsters if you like in the grips of desire for a trilogy which the trilo-,\\nthe the which the the gangster film er very much focused on which is of money \\ner consumer goods and women er and g-, and among those consumer goods cars \\nfigure very importantly so that and think about the way the gangsters are now \\nvery much seen as professionals as organized it's we're we're moving towards \\nthe idea of organized crime as the bi-, as a business er \\nand that in the context of France in the fifties er the idea of organized \\nbusiness would again connote America er rather than than France er one of the \\nkey novels of France in the sixties was a novel called Les Choses er which \\nmeans er things by Georges Perec er and er it was it was published in sixty-\\nthree but it's very much about French society in the fifties and early sixties \\ner er it's a sort of parody of a young couple totally whose life is totally \\ndominated by things goods objects objects that they desire and then one can \\nread the gangsters as er a figuration if you like of that desire for for \\nobjects for things er for er capital er for er for gain and and consumer goods \\nand and again i go and here i would go back just to finish to the point i made \\nabout the new stars of French cinema er the renewal of Gabin's er er stardom \\nand the the the new \\nstardom of Jean-Paul Belmondo and Alain Delon as perhaps an image of that er \\nmirroring of French society okay now we can discuss tomorrow whether you agree \\nwith er one of those two readings or or you think both can be read er \\nconcurrently er and er we will i will just my last word would be to say that er \\nthe figuring of the this hybrid culture between France and America is for you \\nto to bear that in mind and sort of carry it through the course and see how \\nwhen we arrive to a film like Lion that hybridization of French and cul-, and \\nAmerican culture is so different and whereas here we have a utopia of American \\ngoods when we come to Lion we have a complete dystopia of of what American \\nculture means so i'll just er finish on end on this i'm sorry we're just a few \\nminutes late but we did start late er so we'll have er a mini break now and \\nwe'll start the er the video of Bob le Flambeur okay remember there isn't a \\nprint so that's why you're seeing the tape okay \""
