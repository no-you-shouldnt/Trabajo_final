      "that's one of the reasons why they started er a kind of a new wave of the genre \n",
      "of the policiers er in French cinema er but what's interesting about them with \n",
      "the exception of Bob le Flambeur which was very much an independent production \n",
      "is that films like Rififi like Grisbi were very much if you like in Hollywood \n",
      "terms there would be A productions in the sense of the directors were well \n",
      "known they're films with stars with large budgets with sets and so on for \n",
